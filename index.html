<h2>Designs with a purpose</h2>
My name is <strong>Fernando Escobar.</strong>
<br>
My major is <strong>Graphic Design.</strong>
<br>
<p>Welcome to my page!  I will be uploading my work slowly as my education advances so the world can see my skills as well as what I can offer in terms of digital creations and web design.
The main purpose here is to have easy accesibility for everyone to see the vast range of possibilities when creating designs.</p>
